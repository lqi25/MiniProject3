# DSP visualization tools for python
## Introduction
Digital signal processing can analyze, transform, and filter input signals. It has a wide range of applications, such as voice signal processing, digital image processing, vibration signal processing, biomedical processing, and so on. Python contains a variety of visualization libraries that can process digital signals and display the results in a visual form for easy understanding and analysis.

## Visualization tools
### Matplotlib
Matplotlib is the oldest and most widely used data visualization library for Python. Its design is very similar to MATLAB and is the basis for many other libraries.

#### Signal processing
Matplotlib can perform signal processing, such as cleaning noisy sine waves.
